# Digital Image Processing: Face Detection
## Digital Signal Processing Final Project
### Zack Jones, Emma Wadsworth
This project was concerned with exploring the use of digital signal processing techniques for the application of facial recognition. There were two sections: implementation of the canny edge detection algorithm as a method of feature extraction, and a set of experiments comparing the success of cross-correlation facial detection with unprocessed, filtered, and edge-only images.
## 1. Canny Edge Detection
The functions used for canny edge detection are available in the file 'edges.py'. An annotated walkthrough of the algorithm with full code and examples is available in 'edge_detection/edges.html', along with the source jupyter notebook.
## 2. Cross Correlation Experiments
The functions and code used for the cross-correlation experiments is available in the 'DSPcross_correlation.py' and 'DSPtesting.py' files. Datasets are not included, but the complete annotated code is present.
